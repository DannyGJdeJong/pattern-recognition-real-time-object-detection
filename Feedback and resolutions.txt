Feedback project proposal (ALI)

- Why we choose our dataset
- How do we expect it to perform
- Why would it perform good/bad
- Change parameters/archetecture
- Evaluation: try to combine average precision and speed?
	      why do we have precision and not accuracy IOU?




Ideas to improve architecture, mostly from 
'You Only Look Once V4 – Optimal Speed and Accuracy of Object Detection (2020)' (Bag of Freebies)
Methods that only change the training strategy or increase the training cost
-	Data augmentation 
      o	Randomly alter lightning/hue/rotation of images to improve robustness ->generalize model
        especially good to use on underrpresented object classes in training data

-	Object occlusion
	In order to let model perform well when there is occlusion, manually create more occlusion
        in training data by randomly deleting rectangles from image and filling in pixels with 0's.
      o	Random erase
      o	Cutout 
      o	Hide-and seek
      o	Filling in empty spot with othert image

-	Objective function 
     o 	The objective function doesn’t optimize for regression with MSE regression. We could try to use another function (not sure what), probably big-ish change
     o	Change IOU loss function, some researchers have proposed GIOU/CIOU (blz 3)
